# Overview

As the lead full-stack developer in a cross-functional team, I spearheaded the development of Tiny Feet Toolkit, collaborating with a Master's of Environmental Management student from Western Colorado University and engineers from the Colorado School of Mines. This innovative web application supports climate action planning in rural Colorado communities by democratizing access to climate planning tools, aggregating public greenhouse gas (GHG) data, and providing targeted recommendations for climate action initiatives.

Working in an agile environment, I guided a team of seven engineers known as the "30% crew" through the design, implementation, and testing phases of the application. Our impact on environmental planning in underserved areas earned the project a $2,000 grant, validating its potential to drive meaningful change in community climate action.

The project specifically focuses on addressing the unique challenges faced by rural Colorado communities in developing and implementing climate action plans. By providing an accessible, data-driven platform, Tiny Feet Toolkit helps local governments and community leaders make informed decisions about climate initiatives.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Map Tool:** Developed a Google Maps API-powered interface for visualizing geographic data and community metrics, allowing users to compare GHG emissions and climate initiatives across different regions.
- **Data Visualization Dashboard:** Created dynamic charts and graphs to present greenhouse gas emissions data in an accessible format, including historical trends and projections.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Implemented a sophisticated filtering algorithm to provide tailored climate action planning suggestions based on community-specific needs, resources, and characteristics.
- **Community Comparison Tools:** Built features that enable communities to benchmark their climate action progress against similar municipalities and learn from successful initiatives.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Flask:** For building the robust full-stack web application
- **Google Maps API:** For interactive mapping features and geographic data visualization
- **Data Visualization Libraries:** Utilized D3.js and Chart.js for creating dynamic, interactive charts and graphs
- **MySQL:** For storing and managing community data, emissions information, and recommendations
