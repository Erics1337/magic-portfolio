# Overview

I led the technology efforts in Coloradoâ€™s first cross-institutional climate initiative, uniting environmental experts from Western Colorado University and engineers from the Colorado School of Mines to create the Tiny Feet Toolkit. This groundbreaking collaboration bridged the gap between environmental science and software engineering, resulting in an innovative platform that democratizes climate action planning for rural communities.
As technical lead, I directed a diverse team of seven engineers (the "30% crew") while working closely with environmental management experts to translate complex climate science into actionable software solutions. Our unique interdisciplinary approach earned the project a $2,000 grant and recognition as a model for future cross-institutional climate initiatives in Colorado.

The platform we developed represents a first-of-its-kind tool that combines environmental expertise with advanced data visualization, making sophisticated climate planning accessible to rural communities with limited resources. By bringing together academic institutions, environmental scientists, and engineers, we created a sustainable framework for future collaborative climate action projects.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Institutional Data Integration:** Engineered a system that combines environmental data from multiple academic institutions, creating a comprehensive climate planning resource for rural communities.

- **Interactive Climate Visualization:** Developed sophisticated mapping and data visualization tools using Google Maps API and D3.js, enabling communities to understand and analyze their environmental impact through intuitive interfaces.

- **Collaborative Decision Support:** Built features that facilitate knowledge sharing between communities, allowing them to learn from successful climate initiatives and adapt strategies to their local context.

- **Rural-Focused Design:** Created an accessible platform specifically tailored to the needs and resources of rural communities, with offline capabilities and low-bandwidth optimizations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Flask:** Backend framework for handling complex data processing and API integrations
- **Google Maps API & D3.js:** For creating interactive maps and data visualizations
- **MySQL:** Robust database system for managing environmental and community data
- **Redis:** Caching layer for optimizing performance in low-bandwidth environments

## Challenges and Learnings

The project's main challenge was coordinating between multiple institutions and disciplines, each with different approaches to climate action planning. We overcame this by establishing clear communication channels and developing a shared technical vocabulary between environmental scientists and software engineers. This experience provided valuable insights into managing cross-disciplinary teams and translating scientific requirements into technical solutions.

## Impact

Our cross-institutional collaboration achieved several significant outcomes:
- Created Colorado's first inter-institutional climate technology platform
- Received grant funding validating the project's innovative approach
- Established a replicable model for future academic-technical collaborations
- Provided rural communities with previously inaccessible climate planning tools
- Set a precedent for how academic institutions can work together on climate initiatives
