# Overview

As a contractor for Blu Omega, supporting Booz Allen Hamilton, I played a key role in the major initiative to revamp the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) website, a critical resource under the National Institutes of Health (NIH). My primary focus was on enhancing front-end interfaces with extreme attention to detail, significantly improving web accessibility, and ensuring the site met stringent WCAG 2.1 AA and Section 508 compliance standards.

## The Challenge

The NHLBI website serves a vast audience, including researchers, healthcare professionals, and the general public. It was imperative that the platform be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. The project involved addressing existing accessibility gaps within a legacy Drupal system and modernizing its performance and user experience to meet current digital standards.

## My Contributions & Solutions

My responsibilities centered on identifying, designing, and implementing front-end solutions to elevate the site's accessibility and overall quality:

- **Accessibility Audit & Remediation:** I utilized tools like the Chrome browser's ARC Toolkit to conduct thorough accessibility audits, identifying critical issues related to WCAG guidelines and Section 508 requirements. This audit formed the basis for targeted remediation efforts.

- **Compliant Interface Development:** I designed and built new front-end interfaces, ensuring they were fully compliant and user-friendly. Key developments included:
    - A **WCAG-compliant navigation menu** optimized for screen readers and keyboard navigation, ensuring all users could easily traverse the site.
    - An **accessible calendar tool**, allowing users to find and interact with event information without barriers.

- **Meticulous Front-End Implementation:** All new components and existing interface revamps were executed with extreme attention to detail, focusing on semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, color contrast, and keyboard interactivity to ensure a seamless experience for assistive technologies.

- **Legacy System Integration:** I successfully navigated the complexities of the existing Drupal environment, leveraging SASS styling and PHP components to implement the necessary front-end changes and bring the site up to modern compliance standards.

## Impact & Outcomes

My contributions were instrumental in helping the NIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute website achieve its accessibility goals:

- **WCAG 2.1 AA & Section 508 Compliance:** The revamped interfaces and meticulous attention to accessibility standards directly contributed to the site obtaining WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance and meeting federal Section 508 requirements.
- **Improved User Experience for All:** By prioritizing accessibility, the project ensured that vital health information provided by NHLBI became more readily available and usable for people with disabilities.
- **Enhanced Site Performance & Maintainability:** The front-end updates also contributed to better site performance and made the codebase more maintainable from an accessibility perspective.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Drupal:** Content Management System for the legacy site.
- **SASS:** For styling and maintaining CSS.
- **PHP:** For backend logic within Drupal components.
- **ARC Toolkit:** Browser extension for accessibility auditing.
- **WCAG 2.1 AA & Section 508 Standards:** Guiding principles for all accessibility work.
