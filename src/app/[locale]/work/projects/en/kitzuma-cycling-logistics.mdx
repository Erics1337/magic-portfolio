# Overview

At Kitzuma Cycling Logistics, America's first bike-only logistics company, I developed an innovative photo verification system that transformed how high-end bicycles are delivered nationwide. The system requires drivers to photograph each bike at pickup and delivery, documenting its condition and ensuring safe handling throughout the journey. This visual confirmation process, integrated into our custom Salesforce-based Transportation Management System (TMS), provides customers with peace of mind when shipping bicycles worth thousands of dollars.

The photo verification feature was built into a custom mobile interface for drivers, automatically notifying customers with visual proof of their bike's condition at key touchpoints. This transparency led to a significant increase in customer trust and repeat business, particularly from high-end bicycle manufacturers and retailers who require documented proof of careful handling. The system processes thousands of deliveries monthly, with each bike's journey fully documented through our verification process.

Beyond the verification system, I engineered a modern Vue.js marketing platform that integrated seamlessly with our TMS. This allowed customers to instantly book deliveries and track their bikes throughout the shipping process. The platform's success was evident in the numbers: we saw a 25% increase in lead conversions and a 15% growth in business volume, largely attributed to the trust built through our transparent delivery verification system.
