# Overview

As a Full Stack Engineer at Kitzuma Cycling Logistics, I played a pivotal role in enhancing their Transportation Management System (TMS) and digital presence. I led the development of critical software features for their proprietary Salesforce-based TMS, which empowered delivery drivers to verify safe bike deliveries. This implementation not only strengthened customer trust but also contributed to a significant 15% increase in business over a three-month period through real-time delivery confirmations.

A major achievement was the complete redesign of Kitzuma's marketing website using Vue.js framework. This modernization effort focused on improving SEO and user experience, resulting in a remarkable 25% increase in lead conversions within three months. Working closely with the UI/UX team, I created custom front-end designs using Figma and Miro, iterating on component form and function to ensure optimal user experience.

To maintain code quality and reliability, I developed and maintained comprehensive unit tests and end-to-end tests for the Salesforce applications, achieving and maintaining 70% code coverage. This testing infrastructure ensured the stability and reliability of our delivery management system, supporting Kitzuma's nationwide bicycle delivery operations.
