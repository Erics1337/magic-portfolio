# Overview


Social Brain Contacts is an innovative mobile application that I independently developed to revolutionize how people manage their social relationships. Built using React Native and Expo, the app leverages social brain theory to help users organize their contacts into meaningful groups based on relationship strength and type. This scientific approach helps users maintain healthier social connections by aligning with our brain's natural capacity for relationships.

The app addresses a fundamental challenge in our digital age: managing an ever-growing network of contacts while maintaining meaningful relationships. By incorporating insights from anthropology and neuroscience, particularly Dunbar's Number theory, the app helps users prioritize and maintain their most important relationships while keeping track of their broader social network.

## Key Features

- **Scientific Contact Organization:** Implemented contact grouping based on social brain theory and Dunbar's Number
- **Contact Management:** Created an intuitive interface for organizing contacts into meaningful groups
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensured consistent performance across both iOS and Android platforms
- **Privacy-Focused Design:** Built with user privacy as a core principle, ensuring personal data security

## Technologies Used

- **React Native & Expo:** For cross-platform mobile app development
- **GitHub Actions:** For CI/CD pipeline and automated testing
- **Firebase:** For secure backend services and data management
- **Social Brain Theory:** For implementing scientifically-backed relationship management principles

## Impact & Results

The app has made a significant impact in helping users better understand and manage their social relationships:

- Successfully launched on both iOS and Android platforms
- Achieved 200+ downloads across app stores
- Maintained an active user base of 20+ regular users
- Received valuable feedback from 30+ beta testers
- Developed a comprehensive product website (socialbraincontacts.com) explaining the scientific principles behind the app

This project demonstrates my ability to translate complex scientific concepts into practical, user-friendly applications while maintaining high technical standards throughout the development process. It showcases my expertise in full-stack mobile development and my commitment to creating meaningful solutions that improve people's lives.
