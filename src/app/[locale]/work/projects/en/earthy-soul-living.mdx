# Overview

Earthy Soul Living LLC is a small business dedicated to holistic wellness, offering bodywork, energy practices, and a growing library of yoga videos. The client needed a professional online presence that she could manage herself, communicate her unique message, and eventually monetize her video content. My role was to provide a comprehensive solution, from initial setup and training to implementing advanced e-commerce functionality, all tailored to the specific needs and budget of a small business owner.

The project focused on empowering the client to take control of her website's design and content without ongoing reliance on a developer for minor changes, while still providing expert support for more complex technical challenges.

## Key Contributions & Solutions

- **WordPress & Hosting Setup:** I assisted Earthy Soul Living in selecting appropriate hosting and installed WordPress, laying the foundation for a scalable and manageable website.

- **Elementor Site Builder Training:** I chose a suitable WordPress template and provided hands-on training for the Elementor page builder. This empowered the client to customize her site's design, update content, and truly own her online narrative.

- **Client Empowerment & Support:** A core goal was to make the client self-sufficient. While she learned to manage most aspects of the site, I remained available for support when she encountered technical hurdles. This included setting up automated backup solutions, which proved invaluable in quickly restoring the site after any accidental issues, ensuring business continuity.

- **Paid Membership & Video Streaming:** One of the most significant technical features was the implementation of a paid membership system. This allowed Earthy Soul Living to offer subscription-based access to her expanding collection of on-demand yoga videos. This feature not only provided a new revenue stream but also enabled her to connect with and serve her clients remotely.

## Impact & Outcomes

This project successfully equipped Earthy Soul Living with a powerful and flexible online platform. Key outcomes include:

- **Client Self-Sufficiency:** The client gained the skills and confidence to manage her website independently, reducing long-term development costs and allowing for agile content updates.
- **Passive Income Generation:** The membership system for yoga videos created a new, sustainable source of passive income, allowing the business to grow and reach a wider audience.
- **Enhanced Client Connection:** The on-demand video library helped the client stay connected with her community, offering valuable services regardless of geographical limitations.
- **Technical Resilience:** Automated backups provided peace of mind and a quick recovery mechanism, safeguarding the client's online business.
- **Showcased Versatility:** This project highlights my ability to understand and cater to the unique needs of small businesses, leveraging technology like WordPress to empower non-technical individuals and help them achieve their business goals online.

## Technologies Used

- **WordPress:** Core content management system.
- **Elementor:** Page builder for flexible design and content management.
- **Membership/E-commerce Plugins:** Paid Membership Subcriptions Plugin For managing paid subscriptions and access to video content.
