# Overview

As a contractor at Spruce Technology, I collaborated with a talented team to enhance the Rebuilding California website for the California Transportation Department. Working alongside the core development team, I contributed several pivotal features that helped deliver the project two weeks ahead of schedule and contributed to a 20% increase in site traffic within the first three months of launch.

My focus was on implementing specific technical solutions that improved both the public's access to information and internal content management processes. Through close collaboration with the team, I helped create a more efficient and user-friendly platform that better served both California residents and department staff.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Search Implementation:** Designed and implemented a comprehensive search component using Typesense, enabling efficient indexing and searching across all site publications. This feature significantly improved content discoverability and enhanced the overall user experience.

- **Content Management System Integration:** Successfully configured and integrated Contentful as a headless CMS, providing the content team with autonomous management capabilities. This implementation reduced content update times by 50% and created a more flexible workflow for non-technical users.

- **Interactive Map Enhancement:** Contributed to the migration of arcGIS Web AppBuilder widgets to Experience Builder, resulting in improved map interactivity and a 25% reduction in site load times. These optimizations led to better user engagement with the mapping features.

## Technologies Used

- **React & Gatsby:** Core framework for building the fast, modern web application
- **Typesense:** For implementing advanced search functionality
- **Contentful:** Headless CMS for content management
- **ArcGIS Experience Builder:** For interactive mapping features
- **GraphQL:** For efficient data querying
