# Overview

As a contractor at Spruce Technology, I spearheaded the development of a sophisticated search system for the Rebuilding California website, making it easier for millions of California residents to find information about transportation projects in their area. The search engine I built indexes and provides instant access to details about billions of dollars worth of infrastructure projects across the state.

My primary focus was on creating a lightning-fast, typo-tolerant search experience that could handle complex queries across a vast database of transportation projects, documents, and resources. The implementation significantly improved the website's usability and made critical infrastructure information more accessible to the public.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Search Architecture:** Engineered a comprehensive search system using Typesense that delivers sub-50ms response times across millions of documents. Implemented features like typo tolerance, faceted search, and geospatial queries to help users quickly find relevant project information.

- **Smart Indexing Strategy:** Designed an intelligent indexing system that automatically categorizes and prioritizes content based on relevance, project status, and location. This ensures users see the most pertinent results first, whether they're searching for specific projects, contractors, or locations.

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Developed an intuitive search interface with auto-suggestions, filters, and real-time results that help users discover relevant content even when they're unsure of exact project names or locations. The system handles variations in spelling and terminology, ensuring users find what they need regardless of how they phrase their search.

- **Interactive Map Modernization:** Successfully migrated and upgraded the ArcGIS mapping system from Web AppBuilder to Experience Builder, implementing modern mapping features that integrate seamlessly with the search functionality. This upgrade improved map interactivity and enhanced the visualization of project locations across California.

## Technologies Used

- **Typesense:** Core search engine powering the fast, typo-tolerant search experience
- **React & Gatsby:** Frontend framework for building the search interface and results display
- **ArcGIS Experience Builder:** Modern mapping platform for interactive project visualization
- **GraphQL:** For efficient data fetching and real-time search results
- **Node.js:** Backend services for search indexing and data processing
