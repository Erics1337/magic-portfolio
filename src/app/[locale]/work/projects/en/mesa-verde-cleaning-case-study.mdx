# Overview

Mesa Verde Cleaning is a family-run company serving homes and offices around Cortez, Colorado. Their brief was clear: "Give us a site that matches our fresh branding, ranks on Google, and lets people see a price right away." Eleven days later we launched a lightning-fast one-page experience at [mesaverdecleaning.com](https://www.mesaverdecleaning.com).

ðŸ‘‰ **Live site:** https://www.mesaverdecleaning.com

## Approach

To keep things simple for visitorsâ€”and easy to maintainâ€”we chose a single-page layout. I wrote concise, keyword-rich copy and wired in local-business schema so search engines would understand exactly who, what, and where Mesa Verde Cleaning serves. A friendly colour palette, a custom logo I illustrated for the client, and bespoke icons carried the new brand throughout the page.

At the heart of the build is an instant-quote form. Users pick their property size and cleaning frequency; JavaScript calculates a price on the fly and emails the details straight to the owners. No spreadsheets, no back-and-forth phone calls.

Under the hood the site is all about speed: semantic HTML, minified CSS, tiny SVG graphics, and server-side processing via Vercelâ€™s serverless functions (Next.js API routes).

## Impact

Within weeks the site climbed to the first page for "Cortez house cleaning" and related searches, driving a steady stream of organic traffic. Roughly one in three visitors who complete the quote form convert into booked jobs, freeing the owners from lengthy phone consultations and boosting monthly revenue.

## Tech Stack

Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Vercel serverless functions, Adobe Illustrator for logo design, and structured data for SEO.
