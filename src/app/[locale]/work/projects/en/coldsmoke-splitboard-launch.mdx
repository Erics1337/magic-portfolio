# Overview

For Cold Smoke Splitboards, a boutique manufacturer of premium backcountry snowboards, I created an immersive product launch website that captures the essence of mountain adventure through cutting-edge web animation and storytelling. This project showcased my unique blend of design sensibility and technical prowess, transforming a traditional product showcase into a cinematic journey that mirrors the exhilarating experience of backcountry snowboarding.

The website serves as both a product launch platform and a brand experience, featuring the Voodoo Splitboard through sophisticated parallax animations, scroll-triggered sequences, and interactive product exploration. Drawing from my design background, I crafted every visual element to evoke the pristine mountain environments where these boards excel, while leveraging advanced GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) techniques to create seamless, performant animations that work flawlessly across devices.

The result is a website that doesn't just showcase a product—it tells the story of adventure, craftsmanship, and the pure joy of powder skiing. The immersive experience guides users through a visual narrative that begins with a breathtaking mountain landscape and culminates in detailed product exploration, all while maintaining the premium feel that Cold Smoke's handcrafted boards deserve.

## Key Features

- **Cinematic Parallax Storytelling:** Engineered a multi-layered parallax animation system using GSAP ScrollTrigger that creates depth and movement across mountain landscapes, clouds, and product elements, transforming the scroll experience into a journey through backcountry terrain.

- **Advanced GSAP Animation Architecture:** Implemented sophisticated timeline-based animations with precise easing curves, coordinated element transformations, and scroll-synchronized sequences that maintain 60fps performance while delivering visually stunning effects.

- **Interactive Product Showcase:** Developed a dynamic product rotation system featuring smooth GSAP-powered transitions between multiple product views, complete with hover interactions and automated slideshow functionality that highlights key board features.

- **Responsive Design Excellence:** Created a fully responsive experience that adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile, with optimized animation performance and touch-friendly interactions that maintain the premium feel across all devices.

- **Performance-Optimized Animations:** Utilized GSAP's hardware acceleration and optimized rendering techniques to ensure smooth animations even on lower-powered devices, with intelligent loading strategies for image-heavy content.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js & React:** Modern framework foundation for component-based architecture and optimal performance
- **GSAP (GreenSock):** Professional-grade animation library for complex timeline animations and scroll triggers
- **ScrollTrigger Plugin:** Advanced scroll-based animation control for parallax and reveal effects
- **ScrollToPlugin:** Smooth scroll navigation and anchor linking functionality
- **React Lenis:** Smooth scrolling library integration for enhanced user experience
- **React Intersection Observer:** Efficient viewport detection for performance optimization
- **CSS3 & Modern Web APIs:** Hardware-accelerated transforms and modern browser capabilities

## Design & Animation Challenges

The primary creative challenge was translating the physical sensation of snowboarding into a digital experience. This required developing a visual language that could convey speed, freedom, and the pristine beauty of backcountry environments. I solved this through carefully choreographed animations that mimic the flow and rhythm of carving through powder snow.

Technically, the biggest challenge was orchestrating multiple complex animations while maintaining smooth performance. The parallax system alone involves coordinating over 10 different elements moving at various speeds and trajectories. I achieved this by implementing GSAP's timeline system with optimized transform properties and strategic use of will-change CSS properties to ensure hardware acceleration.

Another significant challenge was creating animations that felt natural and purposeful rather than gratuitous. Every animation serves the narrative—from the initial mountain flythrough that establishes the environment, to the product rotation that showcases craftsmanship details, to the final call-to-action that feels like a natural conclusion to the journey.

## Impact and Results

The Cold Smoke Splitboard launch website successfully elevated the brand's digital presence and product presentation:

- **Enhanced Brand Perception:** The cinematic approach positioned Cold Smoke as a premium, adventure-focused brand that understands its customers' passion for backcountry exploration
- **Improved User Engagement:** The immersive animations and storytelling approach significantly increased time-on-site and user interaction with product content
- **Technical Innovation:** Demonstrated advanced front-end capabilities that push the boundaries of what's possible with web animation while maintaining accessibility and performance standards
- **Design Excellence:** Showcased the perfect marriage of aesthetic design and technical implementation, proving that beautiful animations can enhance rather than hinder user experience
- **Mobile Optimization:** Delivered a consistently excellent experience across all devices, ensuring the premium feel translates to mobile users who represent a significant portion of the outdoor sports market

This project exemplifies my approach to creative development—where design thinking drives technical decisions, and every line of code serves the greater goal of creating meaningful, memorable user experiences. The Cold Smoke website stands as a testament to the power of combining strong design fundamentals with cutting-edge web animation techniques.

The result is a website that feels more like an interactive film than a traditional product page—exactly what a premium adventure brand like Cold Smoke deserves.
