# Overview

At Nularian, I spearheaded the development of the administrative dashboard for Electrify, a revolutionary cloud-native AI call center platform that's transforming how businesses handle customer interactions. As a key engineer on this cutting-edge project, I architected and built the comprehensive admin portal that gives business owners unprecedented visibility into their AI-powered call center operations.

Electrify represents the next generation of customer service technology, utilizing over 5 distinct microservices orchestrated by the Temporal engine to create a robust, fully distributed system that can scale with enterprise demands. My role focused on creating the critical user-facing interfaces that allow administrators to monitor live AI agents, manage user permissions through role-based access control (RBAC), and gain deep insights into telephony performance metrics. The platform seamlessly integrates with industry-standard services like Twilio and Retell APIs while maintaining a secure, multi-tenant architecture.

The impact of this work is already evident in production environments. Encore, a major third-party transportation logistics company, has deployed Electrify to enhance their customer satisfaction while significantly reducing operational costs associated with traditional call center management. The real-time monitoring capabilities and comprehensive analytics dashboard I developed enable business owners to optimize their customer service operations with data-driven insights previously impossible to obtain.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time AI Agent Monitoring:** Engineered live dashboard interfaces using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS that provide administrators with real-time visibility into AI agents handling inbound calls, including conversation status, queue metrics, and performance indicators.

- **Enterprise RBAC System:** Implemented a sophisticated role-based access control system using Supabase that supports multi-tenant architecture, allowing businesses to securely manage user permissions and access levels across different organizational tiers.

- **Advanced Telephony Analytics:** Built comprehensive statistics and reporting interfaces that surface deep insights into call patterns, agent performance, and customer interaction data, enabling business owners to optimize their call center operations.

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture Integration:** Developed frontend interfaces that seamlessly connect with Nularian's GO-based backend services to fetch configuration data, supporting the platform's multi-tenant capabilities while maintaining data isolation and security.

- **Cloud-Native Development Environment:** Utilized LocalStack to replicate AWS services including DynamoDB for local development, ensuring rapid iteration and testing cycles within the distributed microservices architecture.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js & React:** Modern frontend framework and library for building scalable, server-rendered applications with optimal performance
- **TypeScript & Tailwind CSS:** Modern frontend development with type safety and utility-first styling
- **Shadcn Components:** Pre-built, accessible UI components for consistent design system implementation
- **Turborepo:** Monorepo tooling for efficient management of multiple frontend applications
- **Supabase:** Backend-as-a-service for authentication, RBAC, and real-time data synchronization
- **LocalStack & AWS Services:** Local development environment replicating production AWS infrastructure including DynamoDB
- **Twilio & Retell APIs:** Telephony service integrations for call management and AI conversation handling
- **Temporal:** Workflow orchestration engine for managing complex, distributed system processes

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary technical challenge was architecting a frontend system that could effectively interface with over 10 different microservices while maintaining real-time responsiveness and data consistency. This required implementing sophisticated state management strategies and designing resilient API integration patterns that could handle the distributed nature of the backend architecture.

Another significant challenge was creating intuitive interfaces for complex telephony data while ensuring the multi-tenant architecture remained secure and performant. I solved this by implementing efficient data caching strategies and designing component architectures that could adapt to different tenant configurations without compromising security boundaries.

## Impact and Results

The Electrify platform has achieved remarkable success in its production deployment:

- **Enterprise Adoption:** Successfully deployed at Encore transportation logistics, demonstrating the platform's ability to handle real-world enterprise customer service demands
- **Cost Reduction:** Enabled significant operational cost savings for client organizations by automating call center functions while maintaining high service quality
- **Enhanced Customer Satisfaction:** Provided businesses with tools to improve customer interactions through AI-powered agents and data-driven optimization insights
- **Scalable Architecture:** Established a foundation for rapid expansion across multiple industries seeking AI-powered customer service solutions
- **Real-Time Operations:** Delivered live monitoring capabilities that give business owners immediate visibility into their customer service operations, enabling proactive management and optimization

The success of Electrify's admin dashboard has positioned Nularian as a leader in the AI call center space, with the platform ready to scale across various industries seeking to modernize their customer service operations through intelligent automation.
