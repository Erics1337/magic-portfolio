# Overview

As a Drupal Developer for Business Enterprise Institute (BEI), I played a key role in expanding the company's outreach and enhancing its digital presence. During my time at BEI, I developed an online course using a Learning Management System (LMS) that enabled the business to train and certify over 2,000 financial planners nationwide. This initiative led to a significant expansion of BEI's network, contributing to growth of approximately 15% in their network reach and a 20% increase in profitability.

I also focused on improving the visibility of BEI's website by optimizing its SEO performance. Through targeted enhancements, I successfully increased the site's SEO scores, ultimately positioning BEI higher on Google's search results for "Exit Planning" compared to its competitors. This increased online visibility attracted more potential clients and improved the company's market presence.

In addition, I leveraged Figma to design and present visual concepts for the website, which I then implemented into the Drupal site. These design improvements enhanced user engagement, leading to a notable increase in the time visitors spent on the site. My contributions not only supported BEI's educational mission but also drove meaningful growth in their business operations and online impact.

The online course significantly expanded their network reach and profitability, while the SEO improvements increased their online visibility and attracted more potential clients.
