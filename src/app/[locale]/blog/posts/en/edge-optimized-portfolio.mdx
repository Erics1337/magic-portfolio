When migrating my portfolio to Cloudflare Pages, I faced an interesting challenge: how to maintain the dynamic feel of my MDX-based blog while leveraging the performance benefits of edge computing. The solution led me down a path of rethinking content delivery and build-time optimization, ultimately resulting in a faster, more efficient site architecture.

## The Initial Challenge

My portfolio site was built with Next.js and used the filesystem to read MDX files for blog posts and project showcases. While this worked well in a traditional server environment, it presented challenges when moving to edge computing:

- Edge functions can't access the filesystem directly
- Dynamic content needs to be available globally
- Build-time vs. runtime trade-offs needed careful consideration

The traditional approach of reading MDX files at runtime wouldn't work at the edge. I needed a new strategy.

## The Edge-First Architecture

The solution I implemented revolves around a build-time content generation system that pre-processes all MDX content into static JSON files. Here's how it works:

```typescript
async function generateContentJson(contentType: string, locale: string) {
    const contentDir = path.join(
        process.cwd(), 
        'src/app/[locale]', 
        contentType === 'blog' ? 'blog/posts' : 'work/projects',
        locale
    );
    
    // Create output directory for static JSON
    const outputDir = path.join(
        process.cwd(), 
        'public/content', 
        locale, 
        contentType
    );
    
    // Process MDX files into JSON
    const mdxFiles = await getMDXFiles(contentDir);
    const posts = await Promise.all(
        mdxFiles.map(async (file) => {
            const filePath = path.join(contentDir, file);
            return await readMDXFile(filePath);
        })
    );
    
    // Write optimized content for edge delivery
    await fs.promises.writeFile(
        path.join(outputDir, 'content.json'),
        JSON.stringify(posts, null, 2)
    );
}
```

This script runs during the build process, converting all MDX content into optimized JSON files that can be served directly from Cloudflare's global CDN.

## Edge-Optimized Content Delivery

The edge functions themselves became remarkably simple and efficient:

```typescript
async function getPosts(contentType: string, locale: string): Promise<Post[]> {
    try {
        const baseUrl = process.env.VERCEL_URL 
            ? `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`
            : process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
                ? 'http://localhost:3000'
                : '';

        const response = await fetch(
            `${baseUrl}/content/${locale}/${contentType}/content.json`
        );
        return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error fetching ${contentType} content:`, error);
        return [];
    }
}
```

This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Global Performance**: Content is served from the nearest edge location
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Edge functions only need to fetch pre-generated JSON
3. **Build-time Validation**: Content errors are caught during build, not at runtime
4. **Optimal Caching**: Static JSON files can be aggressively cached at the edge

## Lessons Learned

The journey to edge optimization taught me several valuable lessons:

### 1. Think in Terms of Build Time vs. Runtime
Not everything needs to be dynamic. By moving content processing to build time, we can deliver a faster experience without sacrificing the developer experience of writing in MDX.

### 2. Embrace Edge Constraints
Edge computing's limitations (like no filesystem access) can actually lead to better architecture decisions. By pre-processing content, we ended up with a more scalable solution.

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
The system still works perfectly in development mode, where instant content updates are crucial for iteration speed.

## Implementation Challenges

Of course, the path wasn't without its hurdles:

1. **URL Management**: Edge functions require absolute URLs, which needed careful handling across different environments:
   ```typescript
   const baseUrl = process.env.VERCEL_URL 
       ? `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`
       : 'http://localhost:3000';
   ```

2. **Build Pipeline**: Integrating the content generation into the build process required careful consideration of the order of operations:
   ```json
   {
       "scripts": {
           "build": "tsx scripts/generate-content.ts && next build",
           "generate-content": "tsx scripts/generate-content.ts"
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Type Safety**: Maintaining TypeScript types across the build-time and runtime boundary required careful planning:
   ```typescript
   type Post = {
       metadata: {
           title: string;
           publishedAt: string;
           summary: string;
           images: string[];
           tags?: string[];
       };
       slug: string;
       content: string;
   };
   ```

## Performance Impact

The results were significant:

- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Reduced by ~300ms globally
- **Edge Response Times**: Consistently under 50ms
- **Build Time**: Increased by only 2-3 seconds
- **Runtime Memory Usage**: Decreased significantly without filesystem operations

## Recent Build Optimizations

While implementing this edge-first architecture, I encountered and resolved several critical build issues with Cloudflare Pages:

### 1. Edge Runtime Configuration

Dynamic routes needed explicit edge runtime configuration. I added the following to both blog and work route files:

```typescript
// In [slug]/page.tsx files
```

This ensures these routes are properly configured to run in Cloudflare's edge runtime environment.

### 2. URL Parsing Enhancement

The initial URL parsing implementation caused build failures. I enhanced the content fetching logic to handle URLs more robustly:

```typescript
async function getPosts(contentType: string, locale: string): Promise<Post[]> {
    try {
        // For Cloudflare Pages, use the pages URL or fall back to localhost
        const baseUrl = process.env.CF_PAGES_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || 
            (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'http://localhost:3000' : '');

        // Ensure we have a base URL
        if (!baseUrl) {
            throw new Error('No base URL configured. Set CF_PAGES_URL or NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL environment variable.');
        }

        // Use absolute URL and ensure it starts with https:// or http://
        const url = new URL(`/content/${locale}/${contentType}/content.json`, baseUrl).toString();
        const response = await fetch(url);
        
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`Failed to fetch ${contentType} content`);
        }
        
        return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error fetching ${contentType} content:`, error);
        return [];
    }
}
```

This update ensures proper URL construction and error handling, particularly important for edge environments.

### 3. Module Resolution

To handle import paths correctly, I updated the Next.js configuration:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    // ... other config
    experimental: {
        serverActions: {
            bodySizeLimit: '2mb',
        },
        mdxRs: true,
    },
    webpack: (config) => {
        config.resolve.alias = {
            ...config.resolve.alias,
            '@': '/src',  // Enables proper module resolution
        };
        return config;
    },
};
```

### 4. Import Path Standardization

I standardized import paths across the application to use relative paths, making them more reliable in the edge environment:

```typescript
// Before
import { CustomMDX } from '@/components/mdx';

// After
import { CustomMDX } from '../../../../components/mdx';
```

This approach, while more verbose, ensures consistent module resolution across different environments.

These optimizations significantly improved the build reliability and runtime performance of the site on Cloudflare Pages, while maintaining the benefits of edge computing we discussed earlier.

## Looking Forward

This edge-first architecture opens up interesting possibilities for future enhancements:

- Implementing real-time content updates through revalidation
- Adding edge-based search functionality
- Exploring edge-side rendering for dynamic components

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start with the Edge in Mind**: Design your architecture around edge computing constraints from the beginning
2. **Optimize at Build Time**: Move as much processing as possible to the build phase
3. **Type Safety Matters**: Maintain strong typing across your entire system
4. **Think Globally**: Consider how your content will be delivered worldwide

The shift to edge computing doesn't mean sacrificing dynamic features or developer experience. With careful planning and the right architecture, we can leverage the best of both worlds: the flexibility of MDX for content creation and the performance of edge computing for delivery.

This journey has fundamentally changed how I think about web application architecture. The constraints of edge computing pushed me to create a more efficient, scalable system that better serves users worldwide while maintaining a great developer experience.
